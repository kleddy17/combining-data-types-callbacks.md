// 7. Create a function powerButton that returns a

//options should console.log a simple message like select a song.
//Call that inner function

// 1. Model a Vending Machine Model a vending machine
// a vending machine is an object
// it has an array of snacks (make 3 snacks)
// snacks are objects that have a name and a price

const vendingMachine = { 
    // here we have an object vending machine
    //that has an array snacks
    // that has two objects
    snacks:[{name: "chips", price: 2.00},{name: "skittles", 3.00},],
    //here is a function within vending machine
    // that passes a method called arrPosition
    vend: (arrPosition) => {
    // going into vendingMachine and then going in to snacks
    //at the index of in this case 2 because that is 
    //what we passed in and we are get the keyname
    return vendingMachine.snacks[arrPosition].name;
}
}
vendingMachine.vend(2);

//a vending machine has a function vend that allows 
//user to enter the array position (a number) 
//of the snack and then that snack will be returned
// Be able to call vendingMachine.vend() with a valid integer to return a snack

// 1. Make a function add that takes two arguments (numbers) and sums them together

const add = (num1, num2) => {
    return num1 + num2
}
console.log(add(1,2))

// 2. Make a function subtract that takes two arguments (numbers) and subtracts them
const substract = (num1, num2) => {
    return num1 - num2
}
console.log(subtract(3,1))


// 3. Make a function multiply that takes two arguments and multiplies them
const multiply = (num1, num2) =>{
    return num1 * num2
}
console.log(multiply(4,5))
// 4. Make a function divide that takes two arguments and divides them
 const divide = (num1, num2) => {
     return num1 / num2
 }
console.log(divide(20,5))

// 5. Make a function calculate that takes three arguments. 
// Assume the two arguments are a number ie num1, num2 and a function 
// called operates (a callback).


const calculate = ((), num1, num2) => {
    const operates =
    }

// Make it so that when calculate is invoked, the callback "operates" on the 
// numbers and returns the value.
// Call calculate 4 times, each time using one of the operation functions you wrote


// Function definition placement


// Clean up this code, so that it works and has function definitions 
//in the correct place

// 1. 
// bar();
// const bar = () => {
//     console.log('bar here');
// }

// Answer. Here is my fixed code
// I moved bar(); to the proper place to
// invoke the function. I also added a arguement and instead of console.log 
// what the user was passing in, I console logged the arguement so the user 
// could pass any data they wanted
const bar = (word) => {
    console.log(word)
}
bar('bar here');


// 2. 
// foo();
// const foo = () => {
//     console.log('foo here');
// }

// // Error reading
// // What is meant by the error(s) this produces?

// foo();

// const foo ()=>{
//     console.log('hi');
// }
