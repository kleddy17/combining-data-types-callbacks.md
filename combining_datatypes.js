// Model a Vending Machine Model a vending machine

// a vending machine is an object

// it has an array of snacks (make 3 snacks)

// snacks are objects that have a name and a price

//a vending machine has a function vend that allows 
//user to enter the array position (a number) 
//of the snack and then that snack will be returned


// Be able to call vendingMachine.vend() with a valid integer to return a snack




// Callbacks
// Make a function add that takes two arguments (numbers) and sums them together


// Make a function subtract that takes two arguments (numbers) and subtracts them



// Make a function multiply that takes two arguments and multiplies them


// Make a function divide that takes two arguments and divides them



// Make a function calculate that takes three arguments. 
//Assume the two arguments are a number ie num1, num2 and a function 
//called operates (a callback).



// Make it so that when calculate is invoked, the callback "operates" on the 
//numbers and returns the value.

// Call calculate 4 times, each time using one of the operation functions you wrote


// Function definition placement
